ETL and data analysis project using Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Matplotlib. Built for junior data engineering practice.
# 🛍️ Retail ETL Project

A beginner-friendly ETL and data analytics project built using **Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Matplotlib**.

## 💡 Project Overview

In this project, I played the role of a Junior Data Engineer at a retail company. I built an end-to-end data pipeline to:
- 📥 Extract sales data from CSV files
- 🧹 Transform and clean the data
- 🗃️ Load it into a SQLite database
- 🔎 Run SQL-style analysis
- 📊 Visualize key sales insights

---

## 📂 Data Used

- **sales_jan.csv** – Sales data from January
- **sales_feb.csv** – Sales data from February
- **products.csv** – Product information (name, category, price)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Skills Used

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite3
- SQL Queries
- Matplotlib
- ETL Concepts
- Data Cleaning and Analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Combined and cleaned multi-month sales data
- Calculated total revenue by product and category
- Visualized sales trends and performance
- Loaded final clean dataset into SQLite for analysis

---

## 💭 What I Learned

- End-to-end data engineering process (ETL)
- Writing SQL queries on top of cleaned data
- Connecting Python with SQLite
- Communicating insights through visualizations

---

## 📣 Future Improvements

- Automate the pipeline using Airflow
- Store data in a cloud database (e.g., PostgreSQL on AWS)
- Build a dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
